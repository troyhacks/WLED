# WLED-MM — ESP32 LED Controller Firmware

WLED is a fast, feature-rich ESP32/ESP8266 webserver for controlling NeoPixel (WS2812B, WS2811, SK6812) LEDs and SPI-based chipsets. 
WLED-MM is a fork focused on higher performance (ESP32, ESP32-S3, PSRAM boards), large installs, and advanced audio analysis.

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

## Setup

- Node.js 20+ (see `.nvmrc`)
- Install dependencies: `npm ci`
- PlatformIO (required only for firmware compilation): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

<!-- HUMAN_ONLY_END -->
## Hardware Targets

| Target | Status |
|---|---|
| ESP32 (classic Xtensa dual-core) | **Primary target** |
| ESP32-S3 | **Primary target** — preferred for larger installs and HUB75 matrix |
| ESP32-S2, ESP32-C3 | Supported |
| ESP32-P4/-C5/-C6 | Will be supported in the future |
| ESP8266 | Deprecated — should still compile, but not actively maintained |

## Build and Test
<!-- HUMAN_ONLY_START -->

| Command | Purpose | Typical Time |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run build` | Build web UI → generates `wled00/html_*.h` and `wled00/js_*.h` headers | ~3 s |
| `npm test` | Run test suite | ~40 s |
| `npm run dev` | Watch mode — auto-rebuilds web UI on file changes | — |
| `pio run -e <env>` | Build firmware for a hardware target | 15–20 min |

<!-- HUMAN_ONLY_END -->

- **Always run `npm run build` before any `pio run`** (and run `npm ci` first on fresh clones or when lockfile/dependencies change).
- The web UI build generates required `wled00/html_*.h` and `wled00/js_*.h` headers for firmware compilation.
- **Build firmware to validate code changes**: `pio run -e esp32_4MB_V4_M` — must succeed, never skip this step.
- Common firmware environments: `esp32_4MB_V4_M`, `esp32_16MB_V4_S_HUB75`, `esp32S3_8MB_PSRAM_M_qspi`, `esp32_16MB_V4_M_eth`, `esp32dev_compat`, `esp8266_4MB_S` (deprecated)

## Repository Structure

tl;dr: 
* Firmware source: `wled00/` (C++). Web UI source: `wled00/data/`. Build targets: `platformio.ini`.
* Auto-generated headers: `wled00/html_*.h` and `wled00/js_*.h` — **never edit or commit**.
* ArduinoJSON + AsyncJSON: `wled00/src/dependencies/json` (included via `wled.h`). CI/CD: `.github/workflows/`.
* Usermods: `usermods/` (`.h` files, included via `usermods_list.cpp`).
* Contributor docs: `docs/` (coding guidelines, design docs).

Main development trunk: `mdev` branch. Make PRs against this branch.

## General Guidelines

- **Repository language is English.** Suggest translations for non-English content.
- **Use VS Code with PlatformIO extension** for best development experience.
- **Never edit or commit** `wled00/html_*.h` and `wled00/js_*.h` — auto-generated from `wled00/data/`.
- **When unsure, say so.** Gather more information rather than guessing.
- **Acknowledge good patterns** when you see them. Positive feedback always helps.
- **Provide references** when making analyses or recommendations. Base them on the correct branch or PR.
- **Highlight user-visible breaking changes and ripple effects**. Ask for confirmation that these were introduced intentionally.
- **Unused / dead code must be justified or removed**. This helps to keep the codebase clean, maintainable and readable.
- **C++ formatting available**: `clang-format` is installed but not in CI
- No automated linting is configured — match existing code style in files you edit. 

Refer to `docs/cpp.instructions.md`, `docs/esp-idf.instructions.md` and `docs/web.instructions.md` for language-specific conventions, and `docs/cicd.instructions.md` for GitHub Actions workflows.

### Feature Flags
- **Verify feature-flag names.** Every `WLED_ENABLE_*` / `WLED_DISABLE_*` flag must exactly match one of the names below — misspellings are silently ignored by the preprocessor (e.g. `WLED_IR_DISABLE` instead of `WLED_DISABLE_INFRARED`), causing silent build variations. Flag unrecognised names as likely typos and suggest the correct spelling.

**`WLED_DISABLE_*`**: `2D`, `ADALIGHT`, `ALEXA`, `BROWNOUT_DET`, `ESPNOW`, `FILESYSTEM`, `HUESYNC`, `IMPROV_WIFISCAN`, `INFRARED`, `LOXONE`, `MQTT`, `OTA`, `PARTICLESYSTEM1D`, `PARTICLESYSTEM2D`, `PIXELFORGE`, `WEBSOCKETS`

**`WLED_ENABLE_*`**: `ADALIGHT`, `AOTA`, `DMX`, `DMX_INPUT`, `DMX_OUTPUT`, `FS_EDITOR`, `GIF`, `HUB75MATRIX`, `JSONLIVE`, `LOXONE`, `MQTT`, `PIXART`, `PXMAGIC`, `USERMOD_PAGE`, `WEBSOCKETS`, `WPA_ENTERPRISE`

<!-- HUMAN_ONLY_START -->
```cpp
#ifdef WLED_DMX_ENABLED // wrong flag - initialization silently skipped
  initDMX();
#endif

#ifdef WLED_ENABLE_DMX // correct flag - initialization performed only when the build supports DMX
  initDMX();  
#endif
```

### Attribution for AI-generated code
Using AI-generated code can hide the source of the inspiration / knowledge / sources it used. 
- Document attribution of inspiration / knowledge / sources used in the code, e.g. link to GitHub repositories or other websites describing the principles / algorithms used.
- When a larger block of code is generated by an AI tool, embed it into `// AI: below section was generated by an AI` ... `// AI: end` comments (see C++ guidelines).
- Every non-trivial AI-generated function should have a brief comment describing what it does. Explain parameters when their names alone are not self-explanatory.
- AI-generated code must be well documented with meaningful comments that explain intent, assumptions, and non-obvious logic. Do not rephrase source code; explain concepts and reasoning.

### Pull Request Expectations

- **No force-push on open PRs.** Once a pull request is open and being reviewed, do not force-push (`git push --force`) to the branch. Force-pushing rewrites history that reviewers may have already commented on, making it impossible to track incremental changes. Use regular commits or `git merge` to incorporate feedback; the branch will be squash-merged when it is accepted.
- **Modifications to ``platformio.ini`` MUST be approved explicitly** by a *maintainer* or *WLED organisation Member*. Modifications to the global build environment may break github action builds. Always flag them.
- **Document your changes in the PR.** Every pull request should include a clear description of *what* changed and *why*. If the change affects user-visible behavior, describe the expected impact. Link to related issues where applicable. Provide screenshots to showcase new features.

### Supporting Reviews and Discussions
- **For "is it worth doing?" debates** about proposed reliability, safety, or data-integrity mechanisms (CRC checks, backups, power-loss protection): suggest a software **FMEA** (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis). 
  Clarify the main feared events, enumerate failure modes, assess each mitigation's effectiveness per failure mode, note common-cause failures, and rate credibility for the typical WLED use case.
